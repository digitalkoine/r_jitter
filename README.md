#Jittered Data Processing in R

This R project is dedicated to geographic data manipulation using the ggplot2 package. Specifically, the provided code reads a CSV file, adds jitter to both latitude and longitude coordinates, and then exports the processed data to a new CSV file.

Instructions

Follow these steps to use the code in your project:

Make sure you have the ggplot2 package installed by running the following command in R:
R
Copy code
install.packages("ggplot2")
Replace "FILENAME.csv" with the path to your CSV file containing geographic data.
Run the provided R code in your R environment.
The code will read the CSV file, apply jitter to latitude and longitude coordinates, and finally save the processed data to a new file named "JITTERED_FILENAME.csv".
